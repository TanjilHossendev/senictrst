            <h2>Privacy Policy for CodeByTanjil</h2>
            <p>Hey there! Welcome to CodeByTanjil, a little corner of the internet I’ve poured my heart into building. It’s a place where folks can crunch numbers for things like board feet, CD interest, asphalt projects, or even their Blox Fruits game stats. I know, it’s a bit of a niche mix, but I love creating tools that make life easier, whether you’re a contractor, a gamer, or just someone trying to figure out a land loan. Since you’re trusting my site with your time—and maybe some of your data—I want to be crystal clear about how I handle your privacy. This policy isn’t just a bunch of legal jargon; it’s my promise to you about keeping things honest and safe.</p>

            <h3>What This Policy’s All About</h3>
            <p>I’ve always believed that trust is the foundation of any good relationship, whether it’s between friends or a website and its users. This privacy policy lays out how CodeByTanjil collects, uses, and protects any information you share when you use our calculators or browse the site. My goal is to keep things straightforward, so you can focus on getting those calculations done without worrying about your info being misused. If something’s not clear, feel free to reach out—I’m here to help.</p>

            <h3>What Info Do We Collect?</h3>
            <p>Let’s get real: CodeByTanjil isn’t some data-hungry tech giant trying to track your every move. My site’s pretty simple, and so is what I collect. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stuff You Type In</strong>: When you use one of our calculators—like the board foot calculator for a woodworking project or the cumulative GPA calculator for school—you’re plugging in numbers. Those inputs (like board dimensions, interest rates, or hours worked) are processed to give you results, but I don’t store them long-term. Once you close the tab or refresh the page, that data’s gone, like sawdust swept off a workshop floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: I do collect some basic info about how you interact with the site, like which calculators you use or how long you stick around. This is done through analytics tools (think Google Analytics or similar), but it’s all anonymized. I’m not peeking over your shoulder; I just want to know what’s working so I can make the site better.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Yep, my site uses cookies, but not the chocolate chip kind (sadly). These are tiny bits of data that help the site remember your preferences, like if you switched to dark mode or picked a language. They’re harmless and mostly there to make your experience smoother.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Info</strong>: If you send me a message through a contact form or email me directly (say, to ask about the Dave Ramsey mortgage calculator or report a bug), I’ll have your name and email address. I only use that to get back to you, and I don’t add you to some random mailing list—promise.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Do We Use Your Info?</h3>
            <p>The info I collect is all about making CodeByTanjil a better place for you. For example, if I notice a ton of people are using the Illinois paycheck calculator, I might tweak it to add more features, like factoring in local taxes. The usage data helps me understand what’s popular and what needs a little love. Your contact info, if you share it, is just for replying to your questions or feedback. I’m not in the business of spamming anyone—I hate getting those emails as much as you do.</p>
            <p>Here’s a quick story: a user once emailed me about the asphalt calculator, saying it helped them save a ton of money on a driveway project. That kind of feedback warms my heart and pushes me to keep improving. But I didn’t keep their email to bug them later; I just thanked them and moved on. That’s how I roll.</p>

            <h3>Do We Share Your Info?</h3>
            <p>Short answer: nope. I don’t sell, trade, or give away your data to anyone. The only time your info might be shared is if I’m legally required to do so—like if a court order comes knocking, which I hope never happens. Other than that, your data stays with me, safe and sound. Even with analytics tools, I make sure everything’s anonymized so no one’s peeking at your personal details.</p>

            <h3>Keeping Your Data Safe</h3>
            <p>I take security seriously, even if CodeByTanjil is just a humble calculator site. I use standard protections like SSL encryption (that’s the little padlock in your browser) to keep your connection secure. My servers are locked down tight, and I regularly update the site to patch any vulnerabilities. That said, no system’s 100% bulletproof—hackers are sneaky—but I’m doing everything I can to keep your info safe. If I ever notice a breach (knock on wood), I’ll let you know pronto and take steps to fix it.</p>

            <h3>Cookies and Tracking—What’s the Deal?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are like the unsung heroes of the internet. They make sure the site remembers you a little, so you don’t have to keep resetting things. On CodeByTanjil, cookies might track which calculator you used last or save your preferred settings. You can totally turn cookies off in your browser if you want, but the site might not work as smoothly. It’s like trying to build a table without a measuring tape—possible, but trickier.</p>
            <p>I also use third-party analytics to get a big-picture view of how the site’s doing. These tools don’t know who you are; they just tell me things like “50 people used the land loan calculator today.” It’s all anonymous and helps me figure out what to focus on next.</p>

            <h3>Your Choices, Your Control</h3>
            <p>You’ve got rights when it comes to your data, and I respect that. Here’s what you can do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Opt Out of Cookies</strong>: Most browsers let you block cookies or clear them out. Check your browser settings if you want to go cookie-free.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Me</strong>: If you’ve sent me an email and want me to delete your info, just say the word. I’ll wipe it from my records faster than you can calculate a GPA.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop Using the Site</strong>: If you’re not comfy with how things work, you can always walk away. No hard feelings—I just want you to feel good about using CodeByTanjil.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>The internet’s always changing, and so might this policy. If I make any big updates—like adding a new feature that collects different data—I’ll let you know by posting a notice on the site or updating this page. I’ll always keep the latest version here, so you can check back anytime. If you’ve got questions, don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>

            <h3>A Quick Note for Kids</h3>
            <p>I love that young folks might be using my calculators—maybe to figure out their GPA or play around with the Blox Fruits calculator. But if you’re under 13, please get your parents’ okay before using the site. I don’t knowingly collect info from kids, and I want to keep things safe for everyone.</p>

            <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
            <p>Building CodeByTanjil has been a labor of love, and I’m grateful you’re here using it. I know privacy can feel like a big, scary topic, but I’m committed to keeping things simple and transparent. Your trust means the world to me, and I’ll always work to protect it. If you’ve got any questions or just want to chat about how the terminus calculator saved your day, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:tangilm80@gmail.com">tangilm80@gmail.com</a>. Thanks for being part of this little project of mine.</p>
